## Short description

  Air Battleships is a twist on the classic Battleships game, where players command aircraft instead of ships. Each player places 3 planes on a 10x10 grid, following the shape 1-5-1-3 (fuselage and wings).
Once all planes are positioned, the game begins. Players take turns guessing the enemy’s plane locations. The first to destroy all opponent’s planes wins!

##How to run
g++ -o AirBattleships main.cpp
./AirBattleships
